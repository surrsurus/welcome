`welcome` will show you your public IP, tasks in your to do list, local weather report, and top posts from hackernews.

## Requirements
The script assumes you have `curl` and `fortune` installed. `curl` is definitely necessary to get information such as weather and Hacker News posts, though you can simply delete fortune from the script if you want. This script also assumes you have `todo` in your PATH, where `todo` is a script I made earlier that you can find [here](https://github.com/surrsurus/todo).
